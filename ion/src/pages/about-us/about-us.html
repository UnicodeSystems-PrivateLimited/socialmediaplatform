  <h4 text-left>StribeIN Inspiration & Background</h4>
  <p>StribeIN.com is a brand of Next Wave Disruptions (NextWaveDisruptions.com). Our goal is to change the way the world connects, socialize and share experiences. Basically make social media better. Moving forward CHANGE is coming your way. Be prepared to be amazed!</p>
  <p>Hemen Patel, Sharvil Patel, Miloni Patel & Naomi Patel are the co-founders of StribeIN.com. First off, Sharvil, Miloni and Naomi inspired me to build a social network to connect students around the world. They being in college, thought it would be great if they could connect with other students who are taking the same subjects as he is, so all students can exchange information, papers, tips and other stuff helping each other. I thought WOW, this is a killer idea. StribeIN was born.</p>
